# Optimizing energy systems with *aristopy*


The Python package *aristopy* is a framework for modeling and optimizing the
design and operation of energy systems.
The name of the framework is derived from the great Greek thinker Aristotle.
For Aristotle, planning and the wise use of human goods represented great virtues.
Transferred to today's time and the design of energy systems, this implies using
appropriate tools that support the planning process and contribute to an
optimal use of the available resources (money, fuel, etc.).

##  Selected highlights
* Flexible modeling of energy systems with only a small number of basic
  components (Source, Sink, Conversion, Bus, Storage) and a comprehensive API.
* Manual scripting of component constraints to enable all types of
  mathematical modeling classes (linear \[LP\], mixed-integer linear
  \[MILP\], mixed-integer non-linear \[MINLP\], etc.).

* Declaration of persistent models to quickly run models iteratively
  after applying small changes (e.g., add an integer-cut constraint).
* Auto-generated visualization of the optimization results with
  flexible plotting routines.
